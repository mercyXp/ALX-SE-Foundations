# The Framework: ALX Problem-Solving Guide

A structured approach to tackling coding problems, emphasizing understanding over quick solutions.

## Steps

### 0. **Read**  
- Thoroughly review all relevant materials (docs, man pages, examples).  
- Test every example in the documentation.

### 1. **Think**  
- **Do not code** until you fully understand the problem and solution.  
- Break problems into smaller parts.  
- Validate logic with examples/edge cases using pen & paper or whiteboard.

### 2. **Think More + Whiteboard**  
- Visualize the problem. Re-read resources if stuck.

### 3. **Ask Why?**  
- Understand core concepts and their purpose. Never accept solutions blindly.

### 4. **Read Error Messages**  
- Most bugs are explained in the compiler/runtime errors.

### 5–6. **Google**  
- Search **specific** questions/concepts.  
- **Never copy-paste**—type everything yourself to ensure understanding.  
- Verify internet answers (many are wrong/incomplete).

### 7–8. **Ask Peers**  
- **Before asking**: Follow prior steps and prepare context.  
  - Example: *"Here’s my code, my approach, and where I’m stuck."*  
- **When helping**: Guide, don’t solve. Use whiteboards; make peers redo the solution.

### 9. **Ask ChatGPT**  
- **Only after steps 1–8**. Use for:  
  - Simplifying explanations (e.g., "Explain pointers like I’m 12").  
  - Debugging: First ask **why** the bug exists, then fix it yourself.  
  - **Never copy-paste code**—retype after understanding.

### 10–12. **Escalate**  
1. Ask **Technical Mentors (TMs)**.  
2. Ask other TMs or staff.  
3. Consult alumni/mentors with **specific, actionable questions**.

## Key Principles  
- **Understanding > Green checks**: Your goal is to become a skilled engineer, not just pass tasks.  
- **Whiteboard first**: Code only after solving the problem conceptually.  
- **No cheating**: Never view others’ code or use AI to bypass learning.  
- **Help others**: Teaching reinforces your own knowledge.
