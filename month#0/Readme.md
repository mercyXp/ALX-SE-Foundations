# Month 0
In **Month 0** of the **ALX Foundations** program, you typically go through an **onboarding and preparation phase** before diving into the core technical curriculum. Here’s a general summary of what to expect:

### **Key Activities in Month 0:**
1. **Onboarding & Orientation**  
   - Introduction to ALX and the Foundations program.  
   - Overview of the learning platform (usually **ALX’s intranet** or **Slack**).  
   - Setting up necessary accounts (GitHub, Slack, etc.).  

2. **Pre-Course Work (Optional but Recommended)**  
   - Familiarization with basic tools:  
     - **Git & GitHub** (version control).  
     - **Command Line (Linux/Bash basics)**.  
     - **Text Editors (Vim, VS Code, etc.)**.  
   - Introductory programming concepts (if new to coding).  

3. **Mindset & Soft Skills**  
   - Emphasis on **growth mindset**, time management, and resilience.  
   - Community-building activities (peer introductions, group chats).  

4. **Technical Setup**  
   - Installing required software (e.g., Ubuntu/WSL for Windows users).  
   - Configuring development environments.  

5. **First Assignments (if applicable)**  
   - Simple tasks to test setup (e.g., pushing code to GitHub).  
   - Basic Bash scripting or C compilation checks.  

### **Purpose of Month 0:**
- Ensure all learners are **technically and mentally prepared** before the intensive coding begins.  
- Build a **supportive community** among peers.  
- Smooth transition into **Month 1**, where core programming (usually **C & Python**) starts.
